---

## ‚ö° MOST COMMON ISSUES & INSTANT FIXES

### 1. Game Won't Start
**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'kivy'`

**Fix:**
```bash
python -m pip install "kivy[base]" kivymd pillow pygame plyer pyinstaller --upgrade
```

---

### 2. Board Not Showing / Black Screen
**Fix:** Close and restart the game
```bash
python main.py
```

---

### 3. Game Crashes When Clicking
**Fix:** Already fixed! Just restart:
```bash
python main.py
```

---

### 4. AI Not Moving
**Fix:** Wait 1-2 seconds (AI is "thinking")
If still stuck: Press "New Game" button

---

### 5. Can't Remove Opponent Pieces After Mill
**Fix:** Already fixed! 
- Click directly on opponent piece
- Make sure it's their piece (orange if you're green)

---

### 6. Windows EXE Build Fails
**Error:** Icon file not found

**Fix:** Icon already created in `assets/` folder
Just run:
```bash
build_windows.bat
```

---

### 7. Pieces Look Wrong / Misaligned
**Fix:** Resize window - board auto-adjusts

---

### 8. Game Too Slow
**Check:**
- AI difficulty (Expert is slower)
- Lower to "Medium" or "Easy"

### 9. Can't Undo Move
**Fix:**

**Fix:** Press "New Game" to reset

---

## üÜò NUCLEAR OPTION (IF EVERYTHING FAILS)

### Complete Reset:
```bash
# 1. Delete cache
rd /s /q __pycache__
rd /s /q .kivy

# 2. Reinstall dependencies
python -m pip uninstall kivy kivymd -y
python -m pip install "kivy[base]" kivymd --upgrade

# 3. Restart game
python main.py
```
